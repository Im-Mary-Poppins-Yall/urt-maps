# urt-maps

A repository for finding and managing hundreds of maps for the game Urban Terror.

Live preview site: https://joncstout.github.io/urt-maps

For project management board, including the todo list, check out: https://trello.com/b/uPz6Y8vV/urt-map-search-website

Developer tip: To make the maps show up locally while running the development server, edit package.json and change the homepage property near the end from "." to "./urt-maps". Remember to change it back before making a public git commit, or before running "npm run build" for production output.

Developer tip2: To get rid of the crypto not found warning, edit node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js as described here: https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/cant-resolve-crypto-in-node-modules-bson-dist-react/143227

##### Pre-generated build details follow, with the deploy option added in

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Does the following "build" step first automatically, then publishes the site to the gh-pages branch. (It used to be hosted on the master branch under the docs folder.)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
